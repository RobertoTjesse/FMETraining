<p>FME has the capability to send email notifications to an external client, and this can either be done using the Emailer transformer in FME Workbench, or using the Email Action in Automations on FME Server. This article aims to provide an overview of why you may choose to use one method over the other depending on your use case.</p>

  <span>An Introduction to Email in Automations</span>
</h2>
<p>It’s important to cover email notifications in some detail because they are one of the most commonly used protocol types on FME Server.</p>
<p>“Email” is a protocol that may be used by both Trigger and Action components in an Automations workflow. Email Triggers receive incoming emails from external clients, and Email Actions send emails out to an external account.</p>
<h2 id="email-protocols">
  <span>Email Protocols</span>
</h2>
<p>In fact, email is not a single protocol. There are several methods of email transfer that exist. FME Server supports two of these email-related protocols: <strong>SMTP</strong> and <strong>IMAP</strong>.</p>
<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the ability to <em>directly</em> receive an email through an email server built into FME Server, or <em>indirectly</em> send an email through an SMTP service, for example, a Gmail account.</p>
<p>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an <em>indirect</em> process that connects to an email account on a server elsewhere. When that account receives an email, the IMAP protocol passes it on to FME Server.</p>
<h2 id="smtp-trigger">
  <span>SMTP Trigger</span>
</h2>
<p>SMTP Triggers are used when data is sent to FME Server via a direct email. FME Server receives an email and triggers an Action in response.</p>
<p>Such triggers are possible because FME Server includes a built-in email server as one of its components. However, this does require that the hostname and domain of your FME Server should resolve to a publicly accessible IP or DNS.</p>

            <p>The steps to set up the built-in email server for notifications are documented in the FME Server Reference Manual.<br /><br />However, FME Cloud instances are automatically configured for email notifications, and have a public domain name too, so you don’t need to do any additional setup.</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-smtp-trigger">
  <span>Creating an SMTP Trigger</span>
</h2>
<p>Creating an SMTP Trigger is done in the Automations: Build Automation section of the FME Server web interface, by choosing the Email (SMTP) protocol as a new Trigger.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.023.SMTPTriggerSettings.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.023.SMTPTriggerSettings.png" alt="Email SMTP Details" class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>Once the protocol type is selected there, is only one parameter that must be configured, that is the Email User Name. This does not need to be an existing user or email; in the above example, it is set up to be AuthoringCourse. Note that you do not need to specify <em>@FMEServer-Hostname.com</em> in the Email User Name parameter.</p>
<p>To construct the full email address, combine the Email Username with your FMEServer hostname. Now, for this example, whenever an email is sent to AuthoringCourse@<em>YourFMEServerHostname</em> this Automation will receive an incoming message that contains the entire contents of that email, including the from and to address, and any attachments. This information is all processed by FME Server so it can be used to trigger an Action downstream in the workspace.</p>
<p>In the SMTP trigger, there is an Optional Parameter to specify the location to download any email attachments to. If this is not defined, the attachments will still be saved to a temporary location on FME Server.</p>
<h2 id="imap-triggers">
  <span>IMAP Triggers</span>
</h2>
<p>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a variation on email for incoming notifications.</p>
<p>Instead of using the built-in email server, an IMAP Trigger connects to another email server and monitors it for incoming email. When a new email arrives in that account, the Automation is triggered.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-imap-trigger">
  <span>Creating an IMAP Trigger</span>
</h2>
<p>Like the SMTP protocol, IMAP Triggers are set up in the Automations: Build Automation section of the web interface by creating a new or adding to an existing Automation, but this time choosing the Email (IMAP) protocol:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.024.IMAPTriggerSettings.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.024.IMAPTriggerSettings.png" alt="Email IMAP details" class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>This Trigger has significantly more parameters, most are for defining the IMAP (Email) server connection.</p>
<p>There are two important parameters that let you decide what and when to watch this Email Server. The Poll interval determines how often FME Server should check for emails and second, the Emails to fetch decides whether to fetch all unread emails or new emails only.</p>
<p>Like the SMTP Protocol there is a parameter to select an FME Server resource location in which to store any email attachments.</p>
<div class="box message info">

            <p>Most email servers support IMAP functionality, as do the majority of cloud-based email providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo!, etc.; so it’s very easy to have FME Server scan a Gmail account (for example) for incoming mail, and then act on its contents. FME Server has the option to load templates for these popular email providers.</p>

<h2 id="email-actions">
  <span>Email Actions</span>
</h2>
<p>Email Actions are designed to have FME Server send an email in response to a Trigger or Internal Action. The built-in email server in FME Server is only for incoming mail, as is the IMAP protocol, so messages need to be sent via an existing (external) SMTP email server.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-email-action">
  <span>Setting up an Email Action</span>
</h2>
<p>Creating an Email Action is done on the Automations page of the web interface, and must connect to an existing Trigger. You can either create a new Automation and first set up a Trigger, or view existing Automations through the Manage page, where you can then extend these workflows to include an email notification.</p>
<p>There are many more parameters for outgoing mail because the full SMTP server connection parameters need to be defined. However, there is an option to load a template for some of the most common email services.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.025.EmailActionParameters.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.025.EmailActionParameters.png" alt="Email details" class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>Various fields for the email itself (From, To, Subject, Template) can be hard-coded or passed through to the Action from the previous connection in the Automation, whether that be a Trigger or Internal Action. One important parameter is the Email Format, which can either be plain text or HTML.</p>
<p>See the following sections for information on how to generate content for outgoing emails.</p>
<h2 id="who-what-when-where-why">
  <span>Who, What, When, Where, Why?</span>
</h2>
<p>At first glance, the functionality across the two techniques appears similar, as visually they have almost identical parameters. However, when considering which option is most suitable for your project there are a number of questions you can start to ask which may help determine the method to use.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who do you want to receive the email?</li>
  <li>What does the email body contain, is the message static text or dynamic?<ul>
      <li>Attribute information?</li>
      <li>Job information?</li>
      <li>Attachments?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When in the translation do you want to send the email?</li>
  <li>Why are you sending the email, do you even need to run a workspace?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><em>Emailer vs. Email Action Parameters</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-the-emailer">
  <span>Advantages of the Emailer</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Include attribute values in the email body</strong></p>
<p>Using the Emailer transformer means you can pass attribute values into the email body, for example you could use the HTMLReportGenerator and include the html_content attribute to display a prettified report in the email body as opposed to an attachment. </p>
<p><strong>Send email during translation</strong></p>
<p>The Emailer will send an email as soon as a feature reaches the transformer, where as the Email in Automations will only be triggered once the workspace translation has been completed. This provides additional control over which scenarios an email is actually sent out.</p>
<p><strong>Send multiple attachments</strong></p>
<p>The Email Action currently only allows for one attachment to be uploaded, so in order to send multiple attachments, you would have to send these to a zipped file in your workspace, by using the Emailer transformer instead these can remain individual uploads.</p>
<p><strong>Create presets for SMTP settings</strong></p>
<p>If you require a large number of workspaces to send emails, transformers allow you to save parameter settings as Presets, this means that you only need to configure your Email SMTP settings once, and going forward can simply reference this preset.</p>
<p><strong>Keep all components contained in a single workspace</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your personal preference, you may prefer to use the Emailer so that everything relating to that workspace is kept together in a single workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Workspace can be run on Desktop</strong></p>
<p>If this workspace will continue to be run manually as well as through FME Server, then you may choose to use the Emailer so that you get the same result in each platform.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-email-action">
  <span>Advantages of Email Action</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Include Job information</strong></p>
<p>By sending the email after the job has finished, you have access to additional parameters such as about the job, such as the id, status message, time submitted/finished, and the job log.</p>
<p><strong>Free up engine</strong></p>
<p>Using the Email Action allows the workspace to finish and frees up the engine it was using ready to start processing the next queued job.</p>
<p><strong>Send Email from a trigger with no workspace</strong></p>
<p>Using Automations, you can send emails directly in response to a trigger without the need to even run a workspace, this may be particularly useful for FME Server Administrators who would like to monitor events that take place on the system.</p>
<p><strong>Easier to maintain</strong></p>
<p>Once a workspace has been published to FME Server, the parameters can no longer be edited, therefore if there were any changes to the email parameters, for example, the sender credentials, you would have to download, modify and republish the workspace. By using the Email action, you can manage the configuration through the Web UI.</p>
<p><strong>Creates separation in a workflow</strong></p>
<p>By setting up the Email Action, you are not confining the email to a single workflow. You may find this preferable as you can easily identify how things are linked together through the Web UI, it also means you can configure multiple workspaces to use the same email action. </p>
