  <li>Configure and use the DIrectory Watch Trigger.</li>
  <li>Filter messages from Triggers.</li>
  <li>Know how to pass information from a trigger into a Workspace.</li>
</ul>

  <span>Watch Triggers</span>
</h2>
<p>There are several watch triggers: <strong>Directory Watch</strong> and <strong>FTP Watch</strong> are the two most common but other watch services include <strong>Amazon S3</strong> buckets and <strong>Dropbox</strong> directories.</p>
<p>These are trigger-only protocols that monitor folders and FTP sites for any changes, whether that be new files to be added, or existing files modified or deleted. When FME Server sees a change, the trigger message contains the affected file path value.</p>
<p>A common, and perhaps the primary use case for this, is the ability to monitor a folder where datasets are stored. When a new dataset is placed in this folder, FME Server Automations will pass this file path into a workspace to process the data with no need for any manual intervention.</p>
<p>This protocol allows files to be filtered by the action type so that it is not just the creation of a new file that can be monitored. It's also possible to monitor for existing file deletions and modifications.</p>
<p>Some of these watch trigger types have corresponding action protocols whereby FME Server can push files out to that file storage location.</p>

  <span>Workspaces as Actions</span>
</h2>
<p>In Automations Run Workspace is labeled an action since it reacts to an incoming message and therefore must be set up by being connected to a Trigger.</p>

<p>Within an Automation, the Action protocol is called (as you might have guessed) <em>Run a Workspace</em> and falls under the Internal Action Category (orange node).</p>
<p>After selecting Run Workspace as the Action type, the user must first specify a Repository and workspace, the selected workspace is then examined, and a list of its published parameters is provided:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.016.WorkspaceActionParameters.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring4RealTime/Images/Img4.016.WorkspaceActionParameters.png" alt="set parameters for a workspace" class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>Having the parameters in a dialog like this means it is simple and easy to set up a workspace to run however you want it to in response to a trigger. Once created, whenever that Trigger receives a message from the sending client, the action will react by submitting that workspace to run on FME Server.</p>
