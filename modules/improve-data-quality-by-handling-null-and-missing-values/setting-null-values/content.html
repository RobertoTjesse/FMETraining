  <span>Setting Null Values</span>
</h2>
<p>The usual way to set an attribute value is with the AttributeCreator or AttributeManager, and these have an option in their drop-down menu to set a value to null:</p>

<p>Conditional Attributes functionality also supports setting &lt;null&gt; values:</p>

<h2 id="bulk-null-updates">
  <span>Bulk Null Updates</span>
</h2>
<p>The way to handle bulk updates of attributes is with the <strong>NullAttributeMapper</strong> transformer.</p>
<p>The NullAttributeMapper transformer allows the author to check values for any or all attributes on a feature, and convert them in bulk to or from null.</p>
<p>For example, here the author is checking for attributes that are either missing or empty and converting them to nulls:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Advanced-2019/DesktopAdvanced1Attributes/Images/Img1.024.NullAttrMapperExample1.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p>One reason for this might be that the workspace converts data from a format that does not support nulls, to one that does. It's necessary to explicitly map the values here because empty/missing values may be permitted in the output and FME will not automatically map data from empty to null, just because a format supports it.</p>
<p>In this second example, the author is checking attributes for existing null values. If the value is set to null then it gets replaced with a zero:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Advanced-2019/DesktopAdvanced1Attributes/Images/Img1.025.NullAttrMapperExample2.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p>Presumably, this must be a numeric field. If it was a text field perhaps the author would set it to an empty string instead. Unlike before, the author wouldn't need to do this when converting from a format that supports null to a format that doesn't, because FME will map the values automatically when the current state isn't supported.</p>
<p>A better reason for this mapping is that the author wants to carry out a numeric, calculation where zero is a valid number but &lt;null&gt; isn't.</p>
