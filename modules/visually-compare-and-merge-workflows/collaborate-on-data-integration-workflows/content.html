<p>Michael Jordan once said, "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." A similar adage could be said for building data integration workflows with FME: "You can build a good workspace in isolation, but you can build a great one collaborating with your teammates and stakeholders."</p>
<p>Collaboration is vital in data integration projects. Lynda Gratton and Tamara J. Erickson from the Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2007/11/eight-ways-to-build-collaborative-teams" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> that the average team size has increased from 20 to 100 members. With this increase in scale, effective and efficient collaboration becomes simultaneously more challenging and more important.</p>
<p>Additionally, Philip Russom, Senior Manager at TDWI Research, <a href="https://tdwi.org/articles/2009/08/01/collaborative-data-integration.aspx" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">argues</a> that because data integration involves bringing together a variety of technical specialists, collaboration is particularly important. Data integration projects are often as much about integrating the workflows of diverse stakeholders as they are about integrating the data itself. He points out several trends that make collaboration even more important:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More teams are working on data integration projects.</li>
  <li>Data integration requires connecting many data sources and applications.</li>
  <li>Data integration work is increasingly conducted remotely.</li>
  <li>Data integration often must collaborate with other data management disciplines.</li>
  <li>Staff on the business side of organizations are getting more involved in data integration projects.</li>
  <li>Data integration teams often have to work with data governance committees and other oversight bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes to the industry require that you build robust systems for collaborating and keeping track of changes to your workflows. Even as a solo system integrator, being able to track the changes to your workspace over time is key to accurate data delivery.</p>

  <span>Visual Workspace Comparison and Merge</span>
</h2>
<p>Visual Workspace Comparison and Merge in FME Workbench helps you manage collaboration in a way that is secure, reliable, and intuitive.</p>
<p>This is a new tool in FME 2022.0 that will allow you to review the differences between two workspaces across all major non-cosmetic workflow components, including added/modified/deleted </p>
<ul>
  <li>user parameters</li>
  <li>transformers</li>
  <li>custom transformers</li>
  <li>connections</li>
</ul>
<p>After comparing the changes you can then choose which ones you would like to merge.</p>
<p>Just building workflows to automate integration tasks is not enough; you have to maintain them. FME is flexible and offers a low barrier to building complex solutions; this fact means that users from various departments within an organization could build or contribute to a given FME workspace. Additionally, you might work with contractors or solutions providers and need to exchange workspaces to iterate upon them. Visual Workspace Comparison and Merge lets you do this in an easy and effective manner.</p>
