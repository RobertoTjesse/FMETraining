<h2 id="workflow-transformers">
  <span>Workflow Transformers</span>
</h2>
<p>Although data is usually read and written using readers and writers, it is possible to use transformers to do the same tasks. These transformers appear in the Workflows category of the Transformer Gallery, along with transformers capable of handling data in web services.</p>

  <span>Key Workflow Transformers</span>
</h2>
<p>Some of the key workflow transformers, and the tasks that they carry out, are as follows:</p>
<table class="featureTable sort_table">
  <thead class="thead sorted">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Task</th>
      <th scope="col">Transformers</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="tbody">
    <tr>
      <td>Read and Write FME Formats</td>
      <td>FeatureReader, FeatureWriter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Read and Write Web Services</td>
      <td>DropboxConnector, GoogleDriveConnector, SalesforceConnector, SlackConnector</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Read and Write Attributes</td>
      <td>AttributeFileReader, AttributeFileWriter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Receive/Send Data Packets</td>
      <td>JMSSender/Receiver, SQSReceiver/Sender, TCPIPReceiver/Sender</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>These are part of a workflow because they don't necessarily read or write data at the start or end of a translation; they can be set up to read or write data mid-translation. This provides certain advantages over fixed-position readers and writers.</p>
