  <span>Introduction</span>
</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we'll look at some common use cases for the FeatureReader and FeatureWriter and use a Connector transformer.</p>
<p>The scenario is we have a folder full of orthophotos in GeoTIFF format. However, we want to extract the orthophotos as individual rasters covering the area of several downtown neighborhoods. </p>

  <span>1) Start Workbench</span>

<p>Open the starting workspace in FME Workbench 2021.1 or later.</p>
<h2 id="2-explore-the-workspace">
  <span>2) Explore the Workspace</span>
</h2>
<p>This workspace is already mostly configured, but we need to add a FeatureReader and FeatureWriter to accomplish this task. If you examine the workspace, you'll see the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It reads a vector dataset of the neighborhoods in KML format, removes some attributes, and reprojects them.</li>
  <li>We will add the FeatureReader to read the photos based on the areas of the neighborhoods.</li>
  <li>It will mosaic the rasters into one image using the RasterMosaicker.</li>
  <li>Then it will clip the neighborhood features out to create individual raster features using the Clipper.</li>
  <li>Then it will process the rasters to set a NoData band, so the areas outside the photo are transparent.</li>
  <li>Then we need to configure a FeatureWriter to write out the individual raster files.</li>
  <li>Then we can use a Connector transformer to upload the files to a web storage location.</li>
</ol>

  <span>3) Add a FeatureReader</span>
</h2>
<p>Add a FeatureReader to the Orthophotos bookmark above the Dissolver. Connect the Dissolver:Area port to the FeatureReader Input port.</p>
