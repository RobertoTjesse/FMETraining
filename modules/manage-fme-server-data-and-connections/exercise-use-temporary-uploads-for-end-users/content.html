<p>After completing this unit, youâ€™ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use temporary uploads to allow an end-user to select datasets at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-open-and-examine-workspace">

  <span>2) Upload Temporary Data</span>

<p>Now let's pretend that the layer of VotingPlaces data has changed in some way. You can simulate that by simply opening a file browser and making a copy of the GML file.</p>
<p>For example, rename C:\FMEData2020\Data\Elections\ElectionVoting.gml to NewElectionVoting.gml</p>
<p><strong><em>NB:</em></strong> You don't also have to copy ElectionVoting.xsd - it's okay to use that schema file for the new GML dataset.*</p>
<p>We wish to run the workspace with the new data. To use the new dataset for the Source GML prompt, click the browse option:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.211.Ex1.SelectSourceData.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.211.Ex1.SelectSourceData.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>In the dialog that opens, click the Temporary Uploads tab and then on the Upload File button:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.212.Ex1.TempUploadButton.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.212.Ex1.TempUploadButton.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>Select both the files NewElectionVoting.gml and ElectionVoting.xsd and click Open to upload them. Now - back in the prior dialog - click the X button to deselect the XSD file:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.213.Ex1.TempUnselectFile.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.213.Ex1.TempUnselectFile.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>The file needs to exist, but it doesn't need to be selected. Now click OK and then click the Run button.</p>
<p>The workspace will now run to completion using the uploaded dataset.</p>
<p>However - and this is the important part - this was only a temporary upload. The workspace can be re-run immediately, and the data will still appear in the temporary upload section, but it is not a permanent solution. The data is likely to be cleaned up automatically within 24 hours, this is the default unless an FME Server Administrator has modified the clean-up task.</p>
