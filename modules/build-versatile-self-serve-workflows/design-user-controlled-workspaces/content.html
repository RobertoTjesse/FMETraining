<p>Workspace parameters are the key to controlling self-serve and the Data Download service.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-parameters">
  <span>What are Parameters?</span>
</h2>
<p>Parameters are what control FME translations and transformations. Remember that a translation has a hierarchy of different translation components:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.013.WorkspaceComponentHierarchy.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.013.WorkspaceComponentHierarchy.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>Each different level of the hierarchy has a set of parameters that belong to it. That means there are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Workspace Parameters</li>
  <li>Reader Parameters</li>
  <li>Writer Parameters</li>
  <li>Feature Type Parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the available parameters are determined by the author of the workspace.</p>

They will also decide the amount of seasoning it needs and what plate to present it on. Like an FME author, these are the parameters that control the results, and as the creator of the meal I get to choose how best to set them.</p>

<p>Although workspace authors set <em>most</em> of the parameters, in some cases, the end user needs to be able to set some of them.</p>

            <p>To continue the restaurant metaphor: of course, the chef will let you have some decision on your meal. For example, they'll let you decide how your steak should be cooked - rare, medium, or well done - and what sauce you wish to add. They'll also let you select the side dishes. These are the parameters in FME that the user gets to wield instead of the author.</p>

<p>To enable users to select the requirements for their translation, FME includes functionality called <em>User Parameters</em>. User parameters are methods for getting input into a workspace.</p>
<p>When a user parameter is made available to the end-user, it is called a <em>Published Parameter</em>. In a self-serve application, published parameters are important for letting the end-user control how the data is served.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-uses-in-fme-server">
  <span>Parameter Uses in FME Server</span>
</h2>
<p>For self-serve systems, published parameters are most commonly used to set:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What coordinate systems to deliver data in</li>
  <li>What feature types (layers) to deliver</li>
  <li>What geographic area (Bounding Box or Area of Interest) to deliver</li>
  <li>Any other Reader, Writer, or Transformer parameters of use to the user</li>
</ul>
<p>With FME Server, the key to successful workspace authoring is flexibility. Workspaces need to be flexible to allow end-users to make choices without seeing all of the complexity of the workspace or the data behind it. Parameters are one way to accomplish this.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">
  <span>Introduction</span>
</h2>
<p>Parameters control how FME operates: how data is read in, transformed and written out using various FME components. This article will explain the different types of published parameters available within FME as well as go through an example on how to create a published parameter.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-published-parameters">
  <span>Types of Published Parameters</span>
</h2>
<p>There are two types of published parameters in FME: FME parameters and user parameters.</p>
<p>FME Parameters are built into the FME Workbench interface and directly control the translation. Examples of FME Parameters include the WHERE clause, Search Envelope coordinates, and Character Encoding.</p>
<p><img src="https://community.safe.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka14Q000000lKaZ&amp;feoid=00N30000006n8wU&amp;refid=0EM4Q000001YSgj" alt="img4001writerparameters.png" class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p><em>FME Parameters</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>User Parameters as the name suggests are intended for a workspace user. These parameters are created by the workspace author for user input in the translation. These can be tied to an FME parameter, giving a user limited control on readers, transformers, or writers. User Parameters can be linked to provide values to transformers and attributes in a workspace.</p>
<p>There are two types of User Parameters, published and private. A published parameter is visible by the end-user, while a private parameter is visible by the author creating the workspace. User Parameters are optional by default. Setting a parameter to be not optional means a user must enter a value otherwise FME will not run the translation.</p>
<p><img src="https://community.safe.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka14Q000000lKaZ&amp;feoid=00N30000006n8wU&amp;refid=0EM4Q000001YSgk" alt="img4003userparametersinnavigator.png" class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p><em>User Parameters</em></p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-published-parameters">
  <span>Miscellaneous Published Parameters</span>
</h2>
<p>Any parameter in FME can be published and presented to the user as a choice to be made when running a workspace. They don’t have to be specifically related to the Data Download service.</p>
<p>Parameters are published in FME Workbench for use on FME Server.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-a-parameter">
  <span>Publishing a Parameter</span>
</h2>
<p>In FME Workbench, parameters are located in several places, but the FME Workbench Navigator window is the one place where you will find them gathered in a single location:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.014.ParametersInNavigator.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.014.ParametersInNavigator.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there are parameters for the source data location (1) and the destination dataset (2) (which is the one that the Data Download service overrides). There are also parameters for controlling the coordinate system (3), general Reader and Writer parameters (4), parameters for each feature type (5) and parameters for transformers (6).</p>
<p><strong>Needs to be updated</strong></p>
<p>Parameters are published by right-clicking on them and choosing “Create User Parameter.” For example, here a workspace author is publishing a parameter on the LabelPointReplacer transformer:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.015.PublishingParameter.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.015.PublishingParameter.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>The author gets to choose the type of parameter (in this case a Choice of different fixed values), the user prompt, and the default value. When the workspace is run the end-user will now be able to decide what value to set the parameter to:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.016.PublishedParameterOnServer.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring3SelfServe/Images/Img3.016.PublishedParameterOnServer.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Parameter Manager</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-parameter-manager">
  <span>The Parameter Manager</span>
</h2>
<p>In FME 2021.0, we have introduced a new way to manage and work with user parameters in FME Desktop. The new Parameter Manager allows you to see all of your parameters in a single window, as well as create new ones, reorder, as well as group them. For information on creating parameters in FME 2020 and older, please see <a href="https://community.safe.com/s/article/published-parameter-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Introduction to Published Parameter</a>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Support for groups in FME Server will be coming in a future release. For now, parameters within groups appear as ungrouped parameters. </em> </p>
<h2 id="parameter-manager-overview">

<p>The left-hand side of the Parameter Manager is where all of your created parameters are shown, as well as options to add new ones, copy and paste, reorder and delete. </p>
<p>The right-hand side is the parameters for the newly created or selected parameter. This side is similar to how you would have created or edited parameters in the past (2020.2 or older), with some slight modifications in wording. </p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-2020-2-and-2021-0-parameters">
  <span>Comparison of 2020.2 and 2021.0 Parameters</span>
</h2>
<p>Overall, the user parameters will function the same, and the end-user will have the same experience, but now as a user parameter author, you will have a few more options to fine-tune your parameters. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Type is selected in the + drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>Name is now called the Parameter Identifier; this is the name you will see when you select parameters through transformers or readers/writers.</li>
  <li>The Prompt is still the same; this is what is displayed to the user when the workspace is run, as well as on the left-hand side of the Parameter Manager.</li>
  <li>Published and private parameters are still the same and are controlled by selecting/deselecting the Published option.</li>
  <li>Optional has now been renamed to Required. Any Required parameters will be indicated by a red asterisk * next to the prompt.</li>
  <li>Attribute Assignment is now controlled by a check box called Disable Attribute Assignment; this is the same as previously setting the Attribute Assignment to Off.</li>
  <li>Default values are still handled the same.</li>
  <li>With the new Parameter Manager, for certain parameter types, additional configurations have been added to increase parameter functionality. For the Text parameter type, there are additional text configurations such as allowing an Arithmetic Expression or what format the text input would be in, such as plain text, python, java, etc.</li>
